# pd2-predator-pack
Predator Pack is a huge modpack created for PAYDAY 2 that adds a lot of new things to the game in terms of cosmetics, weapons/QoL and many more. This repo has been created to help us get the best workflow and management on the project.

There are two branches: mod_overrides and mods

For mod_overrides branch: 100% of the files from it go to your mod_overrides folder. this branch is helpful in terms of updating the pack since it's split between two mod categories.

For mods branch: all the files from that branch go to your mods folder.

Example path for both branches: mod_overrides branch: everything from it goes to D:\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides mods branch: self explanatory, everything goes to D:\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\mods
