Predator Pack is a huge unofficial modpack created for PAYDAY 2 that adds a lot of new things to the game in terms of cosmetics, weapons/QoL and many more. This repo has been created to help us get the best workflow and management on the project.

# This repo has been created by us, the mod developers in order to help us get the best workflow and management on the project without all the hazzle.

# There are two branches that this mod uses: mod_overrides and mods

For mod_overrides branch: 100% of the files from it go to your mod_overrides folder. this branch is helpful in terms of updating the pack since it's split between two mod categories.

# For mods branch: all the files from that branch go to your mods folder.
# Example path for both branches: mod_overrides branch: everything from it goes to D:\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides 
(example path, I have PAYDAY 2 installed on my D drive)

# mods branch: self explanatory, everything goes to D:\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2\mods (example path, I have PAYDAY 2 installed on my D drive)



You are currently in the mod_overrides branch, the main branch of the main mod. Thank you for downloading our mod and your attention! Have fun.
